Automates the process for signing in and signing out of SGR

## Purpose ##
At the conclusion of the acacdemic year, USMA cadets usually vacate in order to go to Summer training or leave. Over the Summer there are cadets who might be staying in garrison due to Summer classes, training in academic buildings, or for more personal reasons. Because of this, there is a skeleton crew of cadets who man transient barracks whose main role is doing accountability and making sure people have a place to stay. This group of cadets is known as "Summer Garrison Regiment" or SGR. One of the main difficulties of SGR is assigning rooms for people based on their needs and this is usually a lengthy process. This project aims to streamline this process so that less manpower is needed.
